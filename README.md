# How to make your mod compatible with Gorilla Mod Manager 
## Upload it to GameBanana
1. Make sure your mod is correctly zipped like this. \
   Mod.Zip \
     -> Mod.dll
2. Make sure the dependencies are correctly listed in gamebanana. \
   It must have a valid zip file link as an url, a github latest download link or a gamebanana mod link \
     Latest: "https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases/latest" \
     Zip: "https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases/download/v1.6.13/Utilla.zip" \
     GameBanana: "https://gamebanana.com/mods/507053"
   
Failure to comply with those two rules will result in your GameBanana profile/mod being blacklisted from Gorilla Mod Manager.
